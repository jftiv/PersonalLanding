# Hands on with Electrical

One of our goals for our home since moving into it in 2019 was to bring our bathrooms up to date. Both had low vanities, dated tile, and poor lighting. Our primary bathroom is finally done for the most part, except for the mirrors and lighting over the new vanity we installed (this was a learning experience on its own, had to do a lot of drywall after tearing the old one out). I do consider myself moderately handy however I haven't worked much with electrical. This seemed like a simple enough task that I thought I would be comfortable learning on this project to replace the vanity lighting with a new fixture. Maybe in an ordinary house that would have been the case but this project had a few more hiccups than I anticipated. 

## Removing the old lighting

In my previous jobs as an application engineer I had worked with electrical in small circuits setting up test stations and dispensing machines. I had never opened up wiring behind my walls in my house but same concept. In, out, ground. First thing before removing the fixture I cut the power to the circuit and confirmed no load was going to any of the wires with a voltage tester pen. Once I got the fixture off the wall I noticed there was something funky going on behind the drywall. There was a very flimsy board behind a hole punched in the drywall (that was not affixed to a stud or anything solid) and the fixture was screwed into the board on one side and the drywall on the other. There was nothing structural holding this fixture. The electrical now seemed like the simple part of this project.

## Coming up with a new plan

The old fixture always sat kind of tilted, and now it made since why. If I was going to replace this lighting, I didn't want to go forward and make the same mistake. The idea was to install this the "right way." I didn't know the right way so did some research on the youtubes and googling various forums. It seemed like the safest bet was to install an old work box. After making some measurements and trying to figure out which box would work best I realized the boxes designed for lights were a little too big -- the center of the wall here was butted up against a stud and PVC vent tube. I now understand the previous owners workaround, however I wanted something more sturdy. So I decided to use a rectangular electrical box and drill it into the stud that it was pressed up against. 
To do this, I was going to need to tear out a bit more of the drywall than I originally intended, which meant I was going to have to patch the drywall. Knowing this I cut out a large rectangle spanning stud to stud to make it easier on myself to hang a small cut sheet of drywall and mud it back to the wall. Ive attached a picture of the board on the outside of the drywall for dramatic effect. You can see just how little of the board was holding inside the hole on the half that _was_ screwed into it.

## Building up what we broke down

With the old work box installed it was now time to patch the wall and get the light installed. For this I measure out the hole dimensions and cut out the drywall from some spare sheets I had in the garage. I was able to screw the cut piece into the studs with drywall screws and patch up the seems with some joint compound and paper tape. I am not an expert at drywall, this was by far the most annoying part. But I've learned a lot from doing the rest of the bathroom and installing the other vanity and with that I was able to get it patched.

After a few rounds of that and some sanding I hung the light fixture and was able to hang the light fixture pretty easily. The old work box provided plenty of structure and the light rest very nicely and had no lean to it at all. Installed all the glass pieces and the lightbulbs and we had a brand new light fixture. As we were also installing mirrors with the vanity I went ahead and hung those too afterwards (much easier with lighting). Here is the finished product.

In the end my dumbass was off on the measurements of the mirrors and hung the light too low by 2 inches. Which brings us to todays lesson: measure twice, cut (drywall) once.
