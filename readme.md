## This is a **very** basic landing page to display personal works

This personal landing page is meant to be a sandbox to explore new stuff using basic css and js. It is not meant to be over the top with different front end applications. For the time being it is just a barebones playground to try out basic concepts from scratch to try to experiment with the simple stuff.

Yes, a lot of this stuff can be done so much easier with pre-built npm libs and front end frameworks. I would like to experiment with base level DOM mechanics and try to experiment with browser JS more. I understand this is dumb and inefficient, for examples of my work using pre-built frameworks please see my other public repos.

Inside the iframe I hope to showcase more and more personal projects that will use more in depth full stack development works. 

Switched away from sass indentation format to more standard scss format. Exp with Live Sass Compiler extension rather than using runtime compiler to keep project super simple.
